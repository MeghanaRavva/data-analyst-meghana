Objective
The main aim of this project is to design and deploy a scaled and secure data analytics platform to the City of Vancouver in AWS using which the descriptive analytics can be performed on the data of the city considered to be public that is detailed rental standards data which could be achieved through instilling automated data ingestion, profiling, cleaning and data monitoring pipelines. The goals of the project are to guarantee data quality (completeness, uniqueness), make it possible to manage by relying on AWS CloudTrail, provide cost-effective solutions that are cloud-native with the detailed cost estimation and support planning.
Dataset
The data set contains the rental property compliance data of the City of Vancouver, and currently these are unresolved by-law issues in licensed rental properties having 5+ units. It facilitates descriptive analysis in the process of establishing operators and neighborhoods that have many outstanding violations. Important columns are:
•	BUSINESSOPERATOR: Rental property operator of the building which manages its name.
•	DetailURL: Reference to detailed records of by-law concerns with the property.
•	StreetNumber: The number of a street in which the property address is going to be set.
•	Street: Name of the Street where the property under rent is to be.
•	TOTALOUTSTANDING: Total number of unsolved by-law issues in the property.
•	TotalUnits: Number of forms of residential dwelling units on the property.
•	Geom: Geometry discipline standing in the capacity of property data (shape) of spatial (used in mapping).
•	Geo Local Area: The geographic area (or neighbourhood) that the property is located in Vancouver.
•	geo_point_2d - Latitude and longitude coordinates of property to explain geospatial mapping.
Methodology
Preparation and Collection of Data
This data was obtained using the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal and it shows information of rental buildings in the city that have 5+ units and have unresolved by-law concerns. Raw data was posted in Amazon s3. In AWS Glue DataBrew, the Null values in some essential columns (Geo Local Area, geo_point_2d, and Geom) were detected and eliminated. The information was further catalogued in AWS Glue data catalogue to analyse it further.
Descriptive Statistics
•	Total Properties: number of all rental records cleaned.
•	Total Violations: a sum of all the outstanding by-law matters
•	Average Violations per Property: used to determine the density of violation.
•	Top Geo Areas: by Geo Local Area, to find out the areas with the biggest issues.
•	Topmost Violation Operators: Listed property managers according to total outstanding 
Observations and Conclusions
•	Some of the neighborhoods are disproportion said to be the roots of these unresolved by-law issues
•	There are also some property operators who are constantly present in the top bracket with a large number of outstanding violations.
•	A lack of geo-coordinates was an issue of concern so it was the entry or system integration of the data at the source.
Recommendations
•	Concentrate resources devoted to enforcement or inspection for the most violation prone neighbourhoods and recurrent offending operators.
•	Ensure quality of information being entered to prevent the absence of field data, geo-location related.
•	It is worth considering making dashboards with the help of Amazon QuickSight or Power BI in order to monitor more in real-time.
•	Automatically update the dataset and add a timestamp column, so that it is easier to track it and monitor its freshness.
Tools and Technologies
Amazon S3
The main source of data lake with structured hierarchies where data files (raw, cleaned, passed and failed) are kept.
 AWS Glue DataBrew
Profiling, cleaning, and detecting quality problems including missing values, duplicates are used. Facilitated validation and data transformation on a rule basis.
AWS Glue Data Catalog
Assisted with a cataloging of the enriched dataset to be found and accessed into AWS services. Metadata was introduced to govern and trace.
Amazon Athena
Applied to perform SQL queries on the datasets stored on an S3 without having to migrate data to summarise, group, and obtain insights.
AWS CloudWatch
It provided alerting mechanism and monitored stored usage on the S3 and other AWS services utilized on its platform.
AWS CloudTrail
Monitoring usage of users and service activities within the platform to enable security, compliance, and audit needs.
AWS Calculator
To approximate pricing of using the data analytics platform per month depending on S3, Glue, Athena services usage.
Deliverables
Data Analytics Platform in the Cloud
An AWS environment with a complete data analytics platform stored (S3), processed (Glue DataBrew), queried (Athena), monitored (CloudWatch), and governed (CloudTrail).
Made clean dataset as well as enriched dataset.
The basic by-law violations on rentals dataset went through the process of cleaning by dropping missing fields of critical location, as well as validating and ensuring uniqueness, and also enriching.
Descriptive Statistics Analysis
The information can be summarized with the use of the SQL queries of the number of violations by geographic area and allow focused decision-making.
AWS cost estimation report
Storage, processing and analysing services costs by monthly cost projection created with the help of AWS Pricing Calculator.
Attachment of Monitoring and Security
CloudTrail and CloudWatch were setup so as to monitor platform activities as well as performance and access in a way that ensured traceable and secure operations.
Documenting and screenshots
An elaborate report encompassing every step (data ingestion, quality checks, etc.), the reason or cause/impact, tool, and screenshot illustration of the implementation.
Findings
Neighborhoods with Highest Violations:
According to the data summarisation from the SQL query, Downtown, Mount Pleasant, and West End showed that they were the areas that need the most attention by the department as the number of by-law violations in these areas was the highest. The total outstanding violations suggest that the aforementioned districts would be the best places for more specific operations or publicity.
Top Offending Property Operators:
Certain property operators consistently appear across multiple high-violation properties, suggesting potential issues in maintenance practices or compliance awareness.
Uneven Distribution of Violations:
Violation counts vary significantly across geo-local areas, highlighting the need for area-specific policies or inspections rather than a city-wide uniform approach.
Data Completeness Impact:
Missing values in location-based fields (e.g., Geo Local Area, Geo Point ID) initially affected the accuracy of geographic insights. After removing incomplete rows, the remaining data allowed more reliable neighborhood-level analysis.
Suggestions
Based on the analysis, it is recommended that the City of Vancouver prioritize enforcement in high-violation areas such as Downtown, Mount Pleasant, and West End. Property operators with repeated unresolved violations should be engaged through targeted outreach or stricter penalties to improve compliance. Regular automated data quality checks should be implemented to ensure data completeness and accuracy, and dashboard tools like Amazon QuickSight or Power BI could be adopted for 
better visualization and decision-making. Standardizing data collection practices, especially ensuring fields like geo-local area are consistently populated, will enhance analysis reliability. Lastly, establishing strong data governance through AWS tools such as CloudTrail and IAM will ensure secure, transparent, and accountable management of the city’s rental standards data.
